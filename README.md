# NestModelSimplification

Step 1: Download required neuron models Example ((https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/microcircuit#/metype/L5_TTPC1_cADpyr/details))

Step 2: Place scripts from here into the working NEURON model directory

Step 3: `Run Simulator.py` -- Ensuring Optimize Flag is set to "True" %% This will be very time consuming

Step 4: `Run modelfit.py` -- This will fit the data using GIFFittingToolBox 

Step 5: `Run NestGIFModel.py` -- This will take the dictionary of parameters generated by Step 4 and create a basic NEST network


Note: You will need to modify the source somewhat to set paths for data. I have made those locations as obvious as possible ex. `'### FILL IN ###'` should be changed to your path. 

Dataflow: 
-> Simulator will inject a current vector into the NEURON model and save the required current/voltage response to an HDF5 formated file.
--> Modelfit will load that dataset, fit it, and save a pickled dictionary with parameters locally
---> NestGIFModel will use that pickled dictionary to generate the NEST GIF model of choice

Adendum: The majority of the code base is the `CurrentGenerator.py`. It should function stand-alone without modification. The Simulator will require several small edits to ensure paths && Saved data directories are correct. Please be careful that your saved directories are known to the different scripts.
